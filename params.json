{"name":"RF Install Script","tagline":"Robot Framework installation and configuration script, including dependencies, toolls, libs and drivers","body":"### SYNOPSIS\r\n\r\nThis Windows PowerShell script will download and install the Robot Framework, all it's required dependencies \r\n(if not allready available) and some extra libraries and tools.\r\nIf necessary, it will also modify the user 'Path' environment variable, so to include the necessary folders.\r\n\r\nIn the end of the process, the following resources should be installed:\r\n- Python (version 2.7.8 will be downloaded if no RF compatible version is already present).\r\n- PIP (used to install RF, Selenium2library and RIDE)\r\n- Robot Framework\r\n- Selenium2library\r\n- Selenium driver for Internet Explorer\r\n- Selenium driver for Chrome \r\n- wxPython (version 2.8.12.1, necessary to run RIDE)\r\n- RIDE\r\n\r\nThe only part of the script that's not fully automatic is the wxPython installation. You'll still have to go thru the wizard.\r\nIf you are not interested in using RIDE, just comment that part of the script along with wxPython.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT! This script uses the 'setx' command to modify the PATH user variable. This means it won't work in Windows XP or previous, unless it's installed from the Service Pack 2 Support Tools.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT! The installer download locations were valid at the time of this scrip conception, but these may change. If you find some invalid URL please report an issue at https://github.com/joao-carloto/RF_Install_Script/issues\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT! If you really want to do selenium tests on IE, beware that there are some necessary browser configurations to be made. This script doesn't deal with those. For more info check https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver#Required_Configuration\r\n\r\n### USAGE\r\n\r\n- Download or copy/paste this script into a file.
